#Manual for NOKO
This folder contains the 19 page manual as PDF, written in german. Box.pdf is a design template to place NOKO in a
pretty matching gift box.

Both PDF have been written with [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net). The source files, fonts and illustrations are
in the folder [/scribus](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/NOKO/tree/master/manual/scribus), so you can change the manual as you wish or translate it in any language. Please fork or send a copy.
