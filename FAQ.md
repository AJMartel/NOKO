# FAQ

### Why Arduino? A Raspberry PI is much more powerful.
Yes, but much more complicated to install, larger and takes MUCH more battery power. Are there any features missing? I don't think so. NOKO is good as it is.

### Why this crappy LCD? There a cheap colorful touchscreens.
Yes, there are, but the LC display should be an easy-to-read clock and a lightsource. NOKO doesn't need a touchscreen. He has buttons for a more haptical experience.

### Why does it not do or have XXX?
You got a good idea? Write me!

###When did your work on NOKO start?
I started wasting my time in March, 2014.
