These people help me bring life to NOKO:

- **Hans Radke** - (my dad) hardware construction and a lot of soldering
- **Nora Linder** - creating and sewing the monster suit
- **Carsten Caniglia** - the voice of NOKO
- **Ian Berell** - some english translations and spelling. Look at his [bike locks](https://twitter.com/sphykeian)!
