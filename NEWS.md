## 2017
* **07.06.2017** - New IDE 1.8.3 tested. Compiler options in platform.txt aren't working. Again. AVR Core 1.6.19 increases the sketch size by about 760 Bytes. IDE 1.8.3 with AVR Core 1.6.18 takes 17 Bytes more. NOKO stays with AVR Core 1.6.18.  
* **04.06.2017** - Firmware **1.0-040617** - Code shrinking and - as the reason for a new firmware - a nasty bugfix in the distance light settings. A new release will follow soon.  
* **31.05.2017** - Added an early diagnostic tool for NOKO to test functions through serial monitor.  
* **28.05.2017** - Added a TCL/TK Linux firmware flash tool. Should work with OSX, too. A Windows version will follow.  
* **21.05.2017** - Firmware **1.0-210517** - RDS rework. Works MUCH better now. Polling does not block navigation anymore. I am still working on some other improvements, expect a new release in June.    
* **17.05.2017** - **Release V1.0-170517**  
New optimized release. Install it! NOKO will be glad. It is based on firmware 1.0-150517 with the following enhancements:  
  * Custom chars were taken from PROGMEM. That caused too much troubles.  
  * Cleaned up source code, completely in english, including constants, variables and function names.    
  * Autodetection for the display address. Very handy.  
  * Very small bugfixes.  
* **15.05.2017** - Small bugfixes. PROGMEM troubles custom character.  
* **14.05.2017** - The sourcecode is now in English. Renamed constans, functions and variables for better understanding.  
* **02.05.2017** - **Release V1.0-010517 - Buggy removed 29.05.2017**  
First release after initial 120516. Optimized and bugfixed 130417. Now there is enough flash free for future enhancements. Feel free to contact me for ideas, bugs and suggestions.  
* **27.04.2017** - Tested compiling options in platform.txt. They are working again with IDE 1.8.2. This saves about 800 bytes flash.

* **13.04.2017** - Well - it is **1.0-130417** now. Found a more flash-saving way.
